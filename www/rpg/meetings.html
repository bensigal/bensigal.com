                Dungeons and Dragons club currently meets on Tuesdays at lunch in room 46. 
                Membership is completely open, and no sign-up is required. 
                Lunch meetings are mostly informational, to set up meetings for different extra-curricular groups, so it's OK if you miss a couple, or need to leave halfway through.
                </p>

                To get to room 46, cross the bridge into the Millennium building, where computers classes are, and continue down the hall. 
                Room 46 will be on your left. There will possibly be someone in a cloak or with a lightsaber.
