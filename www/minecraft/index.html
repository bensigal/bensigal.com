    <ul>
        <li>
            Upgrade Blood Altar
            <ul><li>
                26 Runes of the Orb
                <ul><li>
                    Automate Blood Orb production? Not necessarily necessary.
                    <ul><li>
                        Put 2 Capacity Cards (do we have any left?) into blood import bus. More items can be accepted.
                        <ul><li>
                            Make a couple if necessary
                            <ul><li>
                                You can not have it automate multiple types of slate at a time. There's a way to do it, but I don't feel like it.
                            </li></ul>
                        </li></ul>
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
            </li></ul>
            <li>
                Do we have enough slates?
                <ul><li>
                    If not, and it's because we don't have enough arcane stone somehow:
                    <ul><li>
                        Work on the conjuration catalyst. I don't remember what's required except for the focused will.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also, we have thousands and thousands of livingrock in a secondary ME. There's a terminal in the botania corner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we run out of thaumcraft Shards, we have thousands of each type of infused stone. I haven't set it up to auto-convert to shards, so you'll have to mine a few manually.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If vis is the main problem, uh...
                        <ul><li>
                            Git gud
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I think my awesome wand of coolness is in my inv.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You getting your own blood wand or one that pretends to hold a candle to it would be a good idea.

                Really, all the stuff I care about is gated behind the pearl.
                <ul><li>
                    Yes please?
                </li>

                    Sinister Lodestone, if you can't find a working node.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Actually, how hard is it to get ichor again?

                We need power generation, but I struggle to think of a large source that you can set up.
                <ul><li>
                    If they're not turned off in infhard, an x64 lava generator (extra utilities) could work.
                    <ul><li>
                        Everburn -> liquid transfer node -> that
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Put the generator where the nether star one currently is.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    IC2 Nuclear Reactor. If you're actually willing to do this and get a good amount of power, GLHF.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ultimate Hybrid Solar Panel. Do we have one? If so, we need to hook it up. If not, it might be worthwhile to make one or two. Requires a stack or two of iridium, though.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We could set up the Trees -> Boiler -> Big Turbine -> Boiler again.
                    <ul><li>
                        Do lava crystals work in MFR Steam Boilers? Could you test?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alternately, everburn->fluid transposer + bucket->MFR Boiler-> fluid transposer + bucket. Steam goes to big reactors turbine. Not sure if this works in infhard.
