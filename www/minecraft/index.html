    <ul>
        <li>
            Upgrade Blood Altar
            <ul><li>
                26 Runes of the Orb
                <ul><li>
                    Automate Blood Orb production? Not necessarily necessary.
                    <ul><li>
                        Put 2 Capacity Cards (do we have any left?) into blood import bus. More items can be accepted.
                        <ul><li>
                            Make a couple if necessary
                            <ul><li>
                                You can not have it automate multiple types of slate at a time. There's a way to do it, but I don't feel like it.
                            </li></ul>
                        </li></ul>
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
            </li></ul>
            <li>
                Do we have enough slates?
                <ul><li>
                    If not, and it's because we don't have enough arcane stone somehow:
                    <ul><li>
                        Work on the conjuration catalyst. I don't remember what's required except for the focused will.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also, we have thousands and thousands of livingrock in a secondary ME. There's a terminal in the botania corner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we run out of thaumcraft Shards, we have thousands of each type of infused stone. I haven't set it up to auto-convert to shards, so you'll have to mine a few manually.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If vis is the main problem, uh...
                        <ul><li>
                            Git gud
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I think my awesome wand of coolness is in my inv.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You getting your own blood wand or one that pretends to hold a candle to it would be a good idea.

                Really, all the stuff I care about is gated behind the pearl.
                <ul><li>
                    Yes please?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sinister Lodestone, if you can't find a working node.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Actually, how hard is it to get ichor again?

                We need power generation bro!
                <ul>
                <li>
                    We could set up the Trees again.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Set up a farm. Take one plot. None of this should be in the cube. Planter underneath center, harvester facing the plot. Both require energy. Both require quartz upgrades. Diamond pipe from the harvester: Saplings -> planter, apples/wood -> chest -> ME. Wood -> Redstone Furnace (must be powered) -> x64 Furnace Gen.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I could change it to a turbine system when I get back.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It's also possible to feed the apples into an x64 culinary gen. Maybe not even x64.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another possibility is to use a lava crystal in a railcraft steam boiler, fed by an everfull, piping the steam into a Big Reactors Turbine.
                    <ul><li>
                        Requires a ton of LP. Maybe expand the wither cage, and put a repulsor over the spawner so the wither skellies don't block each other's spawn?
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Confirmed: All lava-based solutions will fail.
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                IC2 Nuclear Reactor. If you're actually willing to do this, good luck. This is technically also energy generation, but... not very powerful.
