Coil teleports skitter in-costume to a room with him and a few henchmen
Shoots her
It hurts a lot, but doesn't kill her because bulletproofish costume
Skitter has tons of bugs inside her costume constantly, including ones with capsacin (no idea how to spell)
Uses bugs to injure/hurt them, obscure vision
Coil tries to shoot her but doesn't know where she is cuz can't see
decides to just light the room on fire instead w/ molotov cocktails
skitter uses pepper spray (which is highly flammable) to burn soldiers who try to throw them
coil throws cocktail (basically just gasoline) without lighting it on fire yet, uses a burning soldier as the lighter
room now very much on fire
coil closes only door, barricades it
Windows already barricaded
Skitter takes gun from burning soldier, which coil hadn't thought of
Uses gun to break barricade on window
Soldiers outside window
Many bug clones as decoys, bad lighting, bulletproofish costume
Skitter gets increased range from being trapped -> more bugs
Coil keeps saying "don't use grenades"
skitter guesses that it's because of something that happened in another timeline of his power
realizes she can take pins off grenades with bugs
does that
also starts mind gaming them like "haha have tapeworms and hiv"
sneaks up on one guy with bugs, steals keys to truck
drives away

tl;dr: Coil underestimates her, is kind of an idiot sometimes, forgot skitter can use a gun, and forgets that large battlefields with little visibility are where skitter is best
also iirc this is where protectorate changes skitter's rating from (Master 6) to (Master 8/Everything 2)
