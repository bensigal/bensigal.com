        <h1>Purchase</h1>
        Everyone gets to bid as much as they want. This is in the format "3 at 4," which means 
        3 are being bought for $4 each. Once everyone is done bidding, goods are bought 
        according to the bids, in order from highest unit price to lowest. Tie goes to whoever 
        said it first. If there are not enough to be purchased, buy as many as possible.<br>
        Next, adjust the production according to this table:<br>
        <table id="supplyTable">
            <tr><th colspan=2>2d6<br>+ (Price Multiple * Average Sale Price)<br>- Total Produced</th></tr>
            <tr><td>5 or less</td><td>-1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6-8</td><td>No Change</td></tr>
            <tr><td>9-20</td><td>+1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>21 or more</td><td>+2</td></tr>
        </table>
        <h1>Movement</h1>
        Roll off to see who goes first. Highest roller moves all their fleets, then player to 
        their right, etc. Determine distance from fleet to destination. Moving to an adjacent 
        space is 2 points, a "diagonal" one is 3. Remember this number. Roll a number of dice: 
        2 for a fleet of transports, 3 for mixed or all scouts. If your result is <b>over</b> 
        the distance number, you succeed. Otherwise, you are randomized, and move as far as possible 
        in the given direction using the following tool:<br>
        <table>
            <tr><td><button onclick='calculateRandomization()'>Roll</button></td><td id="randomizationResult"></td></tr>
        </table>
        Note that if a fleet of entirely transports is randomized and ends up <b>over</b> 5 
        points away from the nearest star, it is destroyed.
        <h1>Exploration</h1>
        Exploration is not included in an Introductory game.
        <h1>Selling Goods</h1>
        Later demand letters mean that number sold vs. demand number matters more. For example, 
        say a world demands with a number of 8, and 3 units are being sold. A demand letter of 
        "A" would get you the least money, because the lack of supply doesn't matter as much. 
        To contrast, if 10 units were being sold, a demand letter of "F" would get you the 
        least money, as the oversupply matters much more.<br><br>
        Price Determination:<br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Demand Letter</th>

        Demand Number Fluctuation - After something is bought. Demand Number will tend towards the 
        Demand Modifier. You can add to this roll by Advertising before actually rolling the dice. Advertising costs Round(
        Demand Number / 3) for one point. Advertising is illegal on Alpha C, and advertising 
        Drugs is illegal on Sol.
        <table>
            <tr><th colspan=2>2d6<br>- Demand Number<br>+ Demand Modifier<br>+ Advertisement Bonus</th></tr>
            <tr><td>5 or less</td><td>-1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6-8</td><td>>No Change</td></tr>
            <tr><td>9-20</td><td>+1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>21 or mroe</td><td>>+2</td></tr>

        <h1>Maintenance</h1>
        Each player must spend $5 per ship, factor, and home office, or it is destroyed. You may also buy factors during this 
        phase for $10 each. You do not have to pay maintenance for a factor on the turn it is created. After this, calculate 
        Sales Tax. This is 10% of the money you made selling on Sol only, rounded up.
        <h1>End of Game</h1>
        Before the game starts, the player agree on the number of game turns to be completed. Once the final turn is over, 
        everybody gains $10 oer ship, $10 per factor or Home Office, and $2 per unsold unit of goods. The player with the 
        most points wins. Ties are not broken.
