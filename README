Files for bensigal.com. Includes files to run server as well as
resources. Server listens on port 8000 as an https server. Key and
certificate should be at /key.pem and /cert.pem. Also create directory
/server/logs, which is ignored by .gitignore. Another necessary
but not included file is /passwords.js, which is not present
for obvious reasons.

To run the server, execute server/server.js with node. One argument is 
required; the root. For example, if /www and /server are at /home/meep, 
the correct execution would be:

node /path/to/server.js /home/meep
